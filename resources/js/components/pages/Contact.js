                    Sometimes when working with laravel you may face scenarios when you want to display some sort of dynamic widget or complex form. The widget i am talking about here is something more complex to do using normal javascript libraries such as Jquery.
                    An example of this is that i was recently working on a Laravel project, and one of the requirements in the project was to create a multi-step form. The multi-step form must reflect each step the user is currently in the browser url. And als0 the navigation through each step must be smooth with reloading the browser.
